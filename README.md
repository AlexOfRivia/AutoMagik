# ðŸš—ðŸ’© Car Workshop Simulator 20XX: DELUXE EDITION 

**So you wanna be a greasy mechanic, huh? Think you can handle the torque wrench AND the crippling debt? Well, you've come to the right (wrong) place!**

This "project" (and I use that term VERY loosely) is a "car workshop simulation" game. Except it's less "Forza" and more "Forza Dumpster Fire."

## Features (and by "features" I mean "glorified bugs"):

*   **Realistic Car Models:** Mostly just rectangles with slightly different angles. Prepare to be amazed... or mildly disappointed... probably disappointed.
*   **Deep Diagnostic System:** Try to figure out why the engine sounds like a dying walrus. Good luck, buddy. (Spoiler alert: it's probably the `muffler_fart.wav` sound file playing on loop.)
*   **Intricate Repair Mechanics:** Click random buttons until the "repair bar" fills up. Skill-based gameplay at its finest! (Note: May cause car to spontaneously combust. Not responsible for digital arson.)
*   **Customer Interaction:** Listen to angry polygons complain about their non-existent problems. Just like real life! (Warning: May trigger existential dread.)
*   **Financial Management:** Try not to go bankrupt. (Hint: You will. Probably because you spent all the money on cosmetic upgrades for the office rubber chicken.)
*   **Mullet physics**: We spent 60% of our time on getting the mullets to swing just right.

## Installation Instructions (May Contain Traces of Nuts):

1.  Clone this repo. (If you can figure out *how*, you're already further than 90% of the team.)
2.  Install dependencies. (By dependencies, I mean the crippling feeling of failure.)
3.  Run the thing. (Pray it doesn't crash. If it does, blame it on the RAM. It's always the RAM.)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-workshop-simulator-20xx.git
    cd car-workshop-simulator-20xx
    npm install -g i-dont-know-what-im-doing  # Required for maximum chaos
    node index.js
    ```

    (Okay, maybe replace `npm install -g i-dont-know-what-im-doing` with actual dependencies if you're feeling ambitious... but I wouldn't bother.)

## Contributing (Seriously, Don't):

Unless you're a masochist with a penchant for spaghetti code and existential suffering, just... don't. But if you absolutely *insist* on contributing, here are some ideas:

*   **Add more bugs.** (They're the *best* part!)
*   **Improve the "AI" of the customers.** (Make them even *more* annoying. It's a challenge!)
*   **Write a detailed economic model based on the fluctuating prices of rusty lug nuts.** (We're waiting...)
*   **Write a tutorial on how to get out of crippling debt from buying too many mullets.**

**Pull Requests:** Will be ignored. (Just kidding... mostly.)

## License (I Ain't No Lawyer):

DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THIS ABOMINATION. I don't care. Just don't sue me when it sets your computer on fire.

## Known Issues (The Entire Thing):

*   Everything.
*   Seriously, everything.
*   Expect the unexpected... and probably the undesired.
*   May cause spontaneous combustion of digital cars (and possibly your sanity).
*   Has a severe mullet addiction.

## Support (Good Luck With That):

Email me at `dont-even-bother@example.com`. I probably won't respond. I'm busy polishing my virtual rubber chicken.

**Enjoy the ride... or at least, try to tolerate it. You've been warned.**
